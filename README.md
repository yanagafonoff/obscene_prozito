# obscene_prozito

This is an exercise in Digital Humanities studies.
The aim of the project is to get obscene words from prozito diary base
with mystem and Python.

At this moment we can say that probably the most frequent obscene word in the base is 'жид' but the data still needs to be polished. 

the project is on going so statistics is coming soon
